# Impeller .NET bindings

### Running this thing
1) Run InteropGen with /path/to/impeller.h as an argument and pray that ClangSharp is not completely broken for you
2) Run Sandbox with /path/to/impeller.so (or dll/dylib) as an argument. It will only work for platforms where SDL2 can create a GLES context. I've only tested it with Linux with an Intel iGPU, so good luck.


### Handles

Native impeller handles are represented by two separate types:

- FooHandle - a SafeHandle passed to P/Invoke layer
- Foo - a managed wrapper around FooHandle that exposes actual methods and factories in idiomatic .NET style

There is no object tracking, for each call to a native function that returns you an existing `Foo` instance you will get a new `Foo` object with reference counter of the native one being increased by one. 

### Interop generator

The bindings are generated by InteropGen, a simple C# console app that uses CppAst library to parse impeller.h and conver it into `NativeModel` that has some .NET-specific stuff already mapped.

The model is then used to generate the bindings code. Generator is aware of impeller.h naming conventions, so it will place functions to appropriate classes, properly wrap factories for `New`-suffixed methods, call `*Retain` function when obtaining and existing object counter, etc.
